//! An in-memory journal that is a real [`SessionLog`].
//!
//! The host owns the log; this is the smallest host log that obeys the
//! port's contract, so an offline run, a test and a host with nothing better
//! yet read it through exactly the projection a live host's journal is read
//! through. It needs nothing the `offline` feature pulls, so it is always
//! here. Two rules decide who may
//! read a row, and they are the ones a host follows too:
//!
//! - A desk row with `only_for` reaches its author and that one seat.
//! - A row in a conversation reaches the conversation's two seats: the author
//!   of the ask row it hangs off, and the seat that ask was for.
